    "            Design a Cloud-Based Healthcare Patient Portal Architecture. You need to design the architecture for a healthcare patient portal that serves 500,000 active patients across multiple hospitals and clinics.\n",

    "\n",
    "            - Patient medical records access and sharing\n",
    "            - Appointment scheduling with real-time availability\n",
    "            - Secure messaging between patients and healthcare providers\n",
    "            - Lab results and imaging viewer\n",
    "            - Prescription refill requests\n",
    "            - Billing and insurance information\n",
    "            - Mobile app and web interface support\n",
    "\n",
    "            Constraints:\n",
    "            - Must comply with HIPAA and achieve SOC 2 Type II certification, but executives want a \"frictionless\" experience with minimal login steps and fast access times\n",
    "            - $50K/month cloud budget limit, but must handle 10x traffic spikes during flu season and scale to 2M patients within 18 months\n",
    "            - Need sub-second page loads globally, but must keep all patient data within US borders due to regulations\n",
    "            - Business wants 99.99% uptime SLA, but infrastructure budget only realistically supports 99.9% with current resources\n",
    "            - Innovation vs. Stability: Development team wants to use microservices and cutting-edge tech stack, but IT operations has limited expertise and prefers monolithic, proven technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "            Additional Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Must integrate with 15 different legacy Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems using various protocols\n",
    "            - Peak usage: 8am-10am on weekdays (50K concurrent users)\n",
    "            - Average patient session generates 2.5MB of data transfer\n",
    "            - Compliance requires 7-year data retention with audit trails\n",
    "\n",
    "            Deliverables:\n",
